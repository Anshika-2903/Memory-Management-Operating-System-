# Memory-Management-Operating-System-
simulate the behavior of a virtual memory management system that divides  the address space into fixed-size pages. You will implement the following TLB replacement  algorithms:  ● FIFO(First-In-First-Out)  ● LIFO(Last-In-First-Out)  ● LRU(Least Recently Used)  ● Optimal Algorithm
